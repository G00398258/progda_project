### Scope of Project  
***  
21/12 - I'm run into a problem. Originally, I wanted to generate a dataset that would contain information around whether a person on the register of electors chooses to vote in a local or general election. From my research, I have found that age seems to be one of the main variables affecting this outcome. However, I have realised that there is no way for me to view the breakdown of the age of every person on the register of electors, so instead I will be focusing on the voting aged population going forward, rather than just those listed on the register of electors.  

### Issues Encountered  
Throughout this project, the biggest issue I faced was obtaining figures to backup my ideas for my different variables. For example, I found one document ("Election Turnout in Ireland: measurement, trends and policy implications") which I relied heavily on for turnout figures in different elections, but it only covered elections prior to 2016. I was unable to find any other sources that were as indepth for the subsequent elections, and I was aware that I was relying on this one document for the majority of the figures I used. I would have preferred to have more sources to compare the figures against just for accuracy, but these proved difficult to source.  

Another issue encountered was the realisation that there are many factors that influence whether a person chooses to vote or not. Other variables I considered researching were education levels, political engagement and weekend voting, but I found myself under pressure to get the research done for the variables I had already selected, and so I had to limit the scope of my project to the impact of election type, age and geographical location on the decision to vote.  

I also have to acknowledge that while I spent a lot of time researching my variables and trying to understand the relationship between them and the decision to vote, I had to simplify some of them for the sake of this project. For example, we all know that you can have both a local and European election on the same day, or that we can be asked to vote on more than one referendum at a time, and while I do think these situations might increase the level of voter turnout, I was unable to figure out how I would work these situations into my simulation. Therefore, I had to take a more simple approach and assume that in any of the cases simulated in my dataset, only one type of election or vote was taking place at a time, which would not be an overly accurate reflection of this phenomenon in real life.
