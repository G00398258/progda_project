### Scope of Project  
***  
21/12 - I'm run into a problem. Originally, I wanted to generate a dataset that would contain information around whether a person on the register of electors chooses to vote in a local or general election. From my research, I have found that age seems to be one of the main variables affecting this outcome. However, I have realised that there is no way for me to view the breakdown of the age of every person on the register of electors, so instead I will be focusing on the voting aged population going forward, rather than just those listed on the register of electors.
